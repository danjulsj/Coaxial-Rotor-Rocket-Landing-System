  As the rotor is situated about 3/4 the way up the rocket body, the top and bottom layer of blades will be folded upwards and downwards, respectively. We do plan for the top layer of blades to have a trench to fit in so as to not have them flapping around and breaking during ascent. The bottom layer of blades will simply be held in place via an electronic lock. 

  An alternative design was to place the blades and rotor mechanism atop the rocket, but that would facilitate issues with attaching the second stage onto the first stage. So, we put the blades on the side to keep the assembly of the rocket as simple as possible. 

  Ideally, the coaxial rotor would be a pair of hubless rotors (no axle of rotation) which would suit the system's design of being a ring in which the rocket fits. Typical hubless rotors depend on a generated electromagnetic field to turn the rotor, but this design uses the turning of the rotors to generate electricity to power a guidance system. Once powered, the guidance system will act as a drone, either flying to a pre-programmed location or guided by an operator to a designated location.
