Recently, SpaceX has launched their second Starship test flight on Nov. 18 that blew up. 

We all know what Starship is: an experimental super-heavy rocket with a first stage of 33 Raptor engines and a second stage of 6 Raptor engines designed to carry an unprecedented weight of cargo into orbit.
Firstly, let's establish that this rocket doesn't meet the first requirement for a large-scale space program (which we've been discussing throughout this repository): sustainability. 

- What we want is to put heavier stuff into space.
- Our current strategy is to build a bigger rocket

That's dumb.
Let's say we want to put 1 kg of payload into space. What we need is:
- Bigger rocket to fit the payload and fuel
- More fuel to carry that payload up
- More fuel to bring the more fuel to carry the payload up

Let's say we want to put another kg of payload into space:
- Bigger rocket
- More fuel
- More fuel to bring the more fuel

This is a positive feedback loop of adding momre fuel and adding more on top of that. To some extent, this method will work but in the long term the fuel usage versus theoretical payload weight ratio would be untenable. The size of the rocket has to be limited to something vastly smaller than Starship in order to have a sustainable space program.

## We've seen prime examples of how bigger isn't always better. 
### KV-2
Let's start with the KV-2 tank. Sure, sticking bigger guns on tanks was the optimal strategy at the time and a frickin massive gun was definitely bigger, but the overall design was untenable. It's unreliable chassis issues (from the KV-1) was only worsened by an even heavier turret; it was incredibly slow (slower than the KV-1 which was already slow), it constantly broke down and faced mechanical failures due to added weight, it was even harder to maintain (routine maintenance occured far more frequently than the T-34), it stressed supply lines due to its huge fuel appetite, it could only travel across flat terrain (it could hardly climb slopes, its turret couldn't traverse in not-flat terrain, it was extremely top-heavy and prone to tipping over), the list goes on. Bigger, but definitely not better.

### Yamato
Next, lets look at the famous Yamato-class battleships. Largest battleships with the largest fielded naval guns in history and the heaviest armor in naval history (rivaling if not surpassing the Montana-class battleships in some areas). On paper, the Yamato should have flattened nearly every allied battleship in a firefight. However, the size of the Yamato was its downfall. Yamato's massive size compromised her survivability due to increased stress on certain points in its structure and led to increased damage from torpedo hits (despite her torpedo bulkheads, and in addition to other factors and overestimations), which is what eventually sank her. I'm purposefully omitting the fact that allied battleships had far better detection and fire control systems for this comparison.

### whatever this thing would be called
Lastly, the proposed (but never made nor adopted nor accepted nor even considered) 500,000 ton super-dreadnought: 609 meters long, 91 meters wide, super heavily armored (not as much as the Yamato but still pretty dang heavy), super heavily armed (100 16-inch guns, 100 14cm secondary guns, 100 10cm secondary guns, 100 61cm torpedo tubes). This thing would probably steamroll all allied and axis battleships combined. That is, if it were even plausible or reasonable to begin constructing. 
- one torpedo hit would sink the thing.

Some issues in no particular order:
Firstly, it would probably split in two due to the massive strain on the midship structure. If the ship didn't already buckle upon itself, that torpedo would.
Secondly, it would be a massive and easy target for any allied plane
Thirdly, it's theoretically, physically, and literally impossible for a submarine-launched torpedo to miss, and it has no torpedo protection.
Fourthly, it wouldn't be able to move because it's so heavy, let alone turn.
Fifthly, it would completely deplete all financial and natural resources its country had.
Sixthly, it's impossible to service or repair since no drydock can hold it.
Seventhly, it's impossible to build, also because no drydock can hold it.
Eighthly, One broadside salvo would send the thing upside down.
Ninthly, why?

## So... Bigger is not always better.

The same can be said about the Starship. Indeed, to some extent a bigger rocket will be better than a smaller one, but past that extent the bigger rocket will be untenable due to:
- Increased strain on certain parts of the structure
- Too costly to launch with respect to its payload capacity due to increased weight
- Reusability is highly doubted.

This massive rocket would be a highly improbable method for a large-scale space program. It simply costs too much to build and launch, and would probably not yield adequate results. Sure, we stick a 150 ton thing into space, what're we going to do with in?

This principle also applies the the Big Fricking Rocket. This would absolutely not work:
- It's a frickin massive rocket carrying another frickin rocket carrying another frickin rocket. A three-in-one, if you will. It's like a Kinder Surprise but inside is another Kinder Surprise and inside that Kinder Surprise is another Kinder Surprise. Why???
- It would not be reusable at all
- It would be completely useless since the return rocket would have a payload of only ~1/8 or so of the initial launch payload.
It. Won't. Work.
