Recently, SpaceX has launched their second Starship test flight on Nov. 18 that blew up. 

We all know what Starship is: an experimental super-heavy rocket with a first stage of 33 Raptor engines and a second stage of 6 Raptor engines designed to carry an unprecedented weight of cargo into orbit.
Firstly, let's establish that this rocket doesn't meet the first requirement for a large-scale space program (which we've been discussing throughout this repository): sustainability. 

- What we want is to put heavier stuff into space.
- Our current strategy is to build a bigger rocket

That's dumb.
Let's say we want to put 1 kg of payload into space. What we need is:
- Bigger rocket to fit the payload and fuel
- More fuel to carry that payload up
- More fuel to bring the more fuel to carry the payload up

Let's say we want to put another kg of payload into space:
- Bigger rocket
- More fuel
- More fuel to bring the more fuel

This is a positive feedback loop of adding momre fuel and adding more on top of that. To some extent, this method will work but in the long term the fuel usage versus theoretical payload weight ratio would be untenable. The size of the rocket has to be limited to something vastly smaller than Starship in order to have a sustainable space program.

We've seen prime examples of how bigger isn't always better. Let's start with the KV-2 tank. Sure, sticking bigger guns on tanks was the optimal strategy at the time and a frickin massive gun was definitely bigger, but the overall design was untenable. It's unreliable chassis issue (from the KV-1) was only worsened by an even heavier turret,
