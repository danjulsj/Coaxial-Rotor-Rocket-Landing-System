We've built our first prototype of the Cold Landing Rocket. It's currently a rough design since I haven't had experience actually building rockets (and sadly we don't have a metal workshop), with a body of styrofoam duct-taped together and a toy helicopter, but it gives an idea of how this system is supposed to work.

Currently, the craft can hover decently well but can't handle an increase of power (going upwards) lest it tip and fly rotor-first into something, so I'm working on balancing the helicopter on the makeshift rocket body and using the controls for counter-balance when the craft goes sideways. The controls can also be wack and/or unresponsive sometimes so it's all a learning process. 

Building a functioning model that can lift off and land while being controlled is still an ongoing process, especially without the proper tools, materials, or technical know-how (I'm only an HS student). This is only the first prototype for the landing rocket idea which is a main part of the overall SpaceZ system.
