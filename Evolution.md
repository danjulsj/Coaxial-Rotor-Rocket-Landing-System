## This is our family of rocket evolutions from the first to the current. 


### v1.1
Here's the first prototype. It's a rough design (since I haven't built rockets before and unfortunately don't have a metal workshop) with a body of taped styrofoam and a toy helicopter, but it gives an idea about how this is supposed to work.

It can hover rather deecntly, but can't handle any change in power lest it tip over and fly rotor-first into something, so balancing the helicopter on the rocket body is under way. 


### v2.1

This version is seen with its second iteration which is much larger and stable. This iteration uses a foam board bent into a hollow hexagon for its body and a lander salvaged from a previous model that still used styrofoam cylinders. It uses an actual albeit cheap drone instead of a toy helicopter, which means that this rocket is more stable and more easily controlled in flight.

Originally, this second version had the drone strapped directly to the rocket body to prevent the drone from flying off and dropping the rocket body somewhere else, but it experienced one too many crashes and we scrapped that idea. The drone is fine (it's the same one in the image) but now it drags the body up via a magnet, allowing the body to detach and fall to save the drone if strong winds decide to dash the whole thing into the ground.  

P.S. the remnants of 1.2 are in the foreground from which the landers in 2.1 were salvaged. 


### v2.2

Like 2.1, this version uses a foam board bent into a hexagon shape, though it is much taller than 2.1. We widened the base so the rocket won't tip and fall upon landing.

GIF of our first successful flight and landing. Couldn't attempt any longer or higher due to unpredictable winds:

We used magnets to hold the drone instead of strapping it to the rocket body which proved useful in certain situations, namely little to no wind. Following our flight tests, we decided that this static magnet wouldn't work since it could not withstand wind. Now, the drone is attached to the body by a free-moving magnet. In other words, it's holding the body with a magnet that isn't static on the drone. This works wonders for stability and landing (at least at this scale; maybe won't work on a massive real rocket? idk) and allows the body to detach in case of strong winds that would otherwise slam the drone into the ground. Tests have yet to be carried out but will probably be soon.


In latest test, we swapped the magnets for a rod stabilizing system that holds the drone in place while allowing the rocket to have relatively free range of motion.
