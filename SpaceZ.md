## What is it? 

A layout for a large-scale space program for travel to other celestial bodies utilizing a Spaceport-like station in orbit

## Parts to this diagram: Launch + landing, acceleration, interplanetary travel, deceleration, landing
### Launch
The rockets used in this stage are relatively small rockets with a max. size equivalent to the F9. Nothing like the Falcon Heavy or Starship. This stage only launches a dumb payload into orbit. Secondly, the rocket used to send the payload up will return to a designated inspection and refueling station, then prepare for another launch. 
All the rockets used in this stage are cold-landing returnable rockets.

### Acceleration
After the payload reaches orbit, it is then caught by tug drones from the first SP (spaceport) ring, which gives the payload its first acceleration. Once the first wave of drones runs out of fuel, they return to their stations and are replaced by a second wave, and so on until the payload reaches its desired orbiting speed, and is then sent on its way by a last wave of drones. 
Every tug drone will attach, spend its fuel, then return to its respective station on the SP rings.

### Interplanetary travel
Self-explanatory. The payload just flies through space with little guidance using compressed air - similar to how astronauts do spacewalks. 

### Deceleration
Similar to the launching SP, tug drones from the receiving SP will catch the payload in flight and decelerate it using backwards thrust until the payload enters orbit. Then, more waves of tug drones will continue to decelerate the payload until it can land on the target planet on its own. 

### Landing
Once the payload has reached the optimal speed to enter the target planet's atmosphere, it will enter freefall for a little while before deploying its coaxial rotors. These rotors will immediately begin rotating due to airflow around the payload, naturally slowing its descent until the payload deploys its tripod and lands on the target planet's surface.

This system can be implemented on planets/celestial objects all over the place since it's just a sending/receiving station sitting in the orbit of another planet/celestial object. 

### Why?
It's dumb to build a cruise ship in your backyard in, say, Kansas, drive it down to Florida (idk, random state), put the ship into the water, then go sailing. We learned that lesson long ago. So why are we building a spaceship on the ground, launching it into space, and finally letting it go on its travels? We have floating drydocks to build ships in even though we have to source all our materials from inland. Why? So we flood the docks and now the ship can sail on the ocean. We may have to build the basics here on Earth, but the rocket should not start its journey on Earth, just like ships don't start their sail in Kansas. The rocket belongs in space, so build it in space.
