Hot Landings: 
- What it is:
     - Landing using propulsion (F9, New Shepherd, etc.)
     - Fuel used to slow rocket descent
- Fuel Efficiency
       - Uses more fuel overall
           - Requires fuel to land
           - Requires fuel to take landing fuel into atmosphere
- Recovery process:
       - Requires ships to retrieve rockets (extra fuel)
- In case of failure:
       - Rockets can't land anywhere - must be a specific pad
       - Propulsion-based landings are pose explosion hazard to surrounding environment in case of failure
       - Rockets must be manually retrieved
- Landings can cause damage to boosters due to extreme heat

Cold Landings:
- What it is:
    - Landing using other methods than propulsion (no current precedent)
    - Experimental system
- Fuel Efficiency
    - Uses less fuel for same payload weight
        - Does not require fuel to land
- Recovery process:
       - Does not require any retrieval vehicles, landings are completely autonomous
- In case of failure:
       - Rockets do not require special landing pads; can land anywhere
       - Less hazard to surrounding environment: no explosions
       - Rockets, if still operational, can autonomously (or remote controlled) fly back to specific location
- Little risk of damage to boosters as no re-firing of boosters
