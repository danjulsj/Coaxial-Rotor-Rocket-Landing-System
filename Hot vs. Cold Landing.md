Hot Landings: 
- What it is:
     - Landing using propulsion (F9, New Shepherd, etc.)
    - Fuel used to slow rocket descent
- Fuel Efficiency
  - Uses more fuel overall
      - Requires fuel to land
      - Requires fuel to take landing fuel into atmosphere

Cold Landings:
- What it is:
    - Landing using other methods than propulsion (no current precedent)
    - Experimental system
- Fuel Efficiency
    - Uses less fuel for same payload weight
        - Does not require fuel to land
