Hot Landings: 
- What it is:
     - Landing using propulsion (F9, New Shepherd, etc.)
     - Fuel used to slow rocket descent
- Fuel Efficiency
       - Uses more fuel overall
           - Requires fuel to land
           - Requires fuel to take landing fuel into atmosphere
- Recovery process:
       - Requires ships to retrieve rockets (extra fuel)
- In case of failure:
       - Rockets can't land anywhere - must be a specific pad
       - Propulsion-based landings are pose explosion hazard to surrounding environment in case of failure
       - Rockets must be manually retrieved
- Landings can cause damage to boosters due to extreme heat
- At scale:
       - Could be implemented on a large scale, but
       - Too wasteful of resources to maintain a space program in the long run.

Cold Landings:
- What it is:
    - Landing using other methods than propulsion (no current precedent)
    - Experimental system
- Fuel Efficiency
    - Uses less fuel for same payload weight
        - Does not require fuel to land
- Recovery process:
       - Does not require any retrieval vehicles, landings are completely autonomous
- In case of failure:
       - Rockets do not require special landing pads; can land anywhere
       - Less hazard to surrounding environment: no explosions
       - Rockets, if still operational, can autonomously (or remote controlled) fly back to specific location
- Little risk of damage to boosters as no re-firing of boosters
- At scale:
       - Easily implemented on a large scale
       - Reduces amount of resources used (fuel, rockets), more sustainable in the long run



# So why cold landings?
Because hot landings aren't sustainable. At this point in developing a large-scale space program, whether that be establishing human colonies on other planets or just space exploration, we need to be thinking about ways we can cut costs. If we can't afford launching hundreds of rockets per year now, how can we afford launching hundreds of rockets per year in the future if we don't change our ways?
